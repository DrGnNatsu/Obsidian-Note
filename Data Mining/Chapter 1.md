# What is Data Mining?
---
Example 1: Web usage mining (E-commerce website)
- Given: Click stream (click on), Interaction behaviour
- Problem: Prediction of user behaviour.
- Data: Historical records of embryos and outcomes (web log - times: activity).
Example 2: Cow culling
- Given: cows described by 700 features
- Problem: Selection of cows that should be culled
- Data: Historical records and farmers’ decisions (experience provided by humans)

Extracting:
- Explicit: information is not discovered
- Previously unknown: 
- Potentially useful
	Information from data
Needed: programs that detect patterns and regularities in the data (only using a computer to detect the patterns = data mining).
Strong patterns → good predictions
- Problem 1: Patterns are not interesting
- Problem 2: Patterns may be inexact (or spurious)
- Problem 3: Data may be garbled or missing

**Data Mining**: Extraction of interesting patterns or knowledge from the **huge amount of data**. The **process** of **analysing data** from diverse perspectives and summarising it → useful information.
- Alternative name: Knowledge discovery in DB (KDD)
- Attributes:
	- Must be automatic or semiautomatic.
	- The patterns discovered must be meaningful → advantages
# Data Mining Goals
---
Extract information
The ultimate goal is  **PREDICTION**.
# Stages of the Data Mining Process
---
## KDD Process
Input Data → Data preprocessing → Data Mining → Post-processing → Pattern information knowledge

Data Mining:
- ML
- Pattern Recognition
- Statistics
- Visualization
- Applications
- Algorithm
- DB technology
- High-performance computing

## Why the Confluence of multiple disciplines?
- A tremendous amount of data
- High-dimensionality of data (different types of data - picture, text, number)
- High complexity of data (different ways to present data)
- New and sophisticated applications
## ML techniques
Algorithms for acquiring structural descriptions from examples
Structural descriptions represent patterns explicitly
- Predict the outcome in a new situation
- Understand and explain how prediction is derived
