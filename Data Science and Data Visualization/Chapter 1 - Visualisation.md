## Purpose of Visualization
\- The goal of the visualisation is not the beautiful but ==INSIGHT==. 

\- Transform the abstract data into interactive graphical representations for 
* Exploration
* Confirmation
* Communication

\- Good Visualization helps:
- Data accessible
- Combines human 
- Computer strengths
- Enables insight 
- Communicates effectively.
___
## Motivation 
> "Visualization is really about external cognition... how resources outside the mind can be used to boost the cognitive capabilities of the mind."

\- Stuart Card
**→** *used to inform and explore when questions ==aren't well-defined==*
***
## Graphics? 
\- The visualisation is richer, less cluttered, and provides an overview and structure (gestalt effect) → It is more accessible, understandable, memorable, fun, and less formal than textual data.
***
## When Not to Visualize?
\- Visualisation may not be necessary when a question is well-defined on a well-defined dataset (e.g., "What's the unemployment rate?") and can be easily automated. Similarly, visualisation is impractical when rapid automated decisions (high-frequency stock trading) are needed.

## Computer Vs Human?
| Computer | - Data storage<br>- Numerical Calculations <br>- Searching                                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human    | - Planning<br>- Diagnosis<br>- Prediction<br>- Cognition<br>- Common knowledge<br>- Creativity |
⇒ Visualization bridges this gap, with computers providing interactive tools and humans providing insights
***
## Why Use Computers for Visualization?
- Interaction ("drill down"), 
- Integration with algorithms (making visualization part of a data analysis pipeline)
- Efficiency (reusing charts/methods)
- Quality (precise data-driven rendering) 
⇒ Storytelling capabilities.
*** 
## Visualization = Human * Data * Interaction:
\- This formula stresses the crucial role of human interaction in interpreting visualized data.
***
## Why Human in Visualization? 
\- Humans must discover:
- Patterns (clusters, outliers, trends), 
- Apply contextual knowledge, and 
- Take action based on insights. 
\* _However, human cognition has limitations, and visualisations must be designed to account for these._
***
## Why is interactivity important in data visualization? How does it enhance understanding and exploration?
\-  Imagine a map where you can zoom in and out to see different levels of detail. Interactive visualizations let you explore the data at your own pace and discover things ==you might not have seen otherwise==.
