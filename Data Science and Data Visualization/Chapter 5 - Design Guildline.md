___
## Principles
- **States 1**: The visualization should show all of the data and only the data.
- **States 2**: Use the best visual channel available for the most important aspect of the data.

> "Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data – a matter of substance, of statistics, and design"
> 	"Edward Tufte”

- **State 3:** Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.
- **State 4**: Graphical excellence is that which gives the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.
### Tufte’s Integrity Principles
- **State 1**: Show ==*data variation*==, not design variation
- **State 2**: Clear, detailed, and thorough ==*labelling*== and *==appropriate scales==*.
- **State 3**: The size of the ==*graphic effect*== should be directly *==proportional to the numerical quantities==* ("lie factor")
- Line Factor = Size of the effect shown in graphic / Size of effect in data

\- **Main Idea:** Recommends using a baseline that shows the data appropriately instead of necessarily starting at 0.
> Use a baseline that shows the data, not the zero-point
> Ask: Think about: what is a meaningful baseline?

___
## Framing
- Vis ==can be used to lie== as language or statistics.
- *When showing something, make sure that you're faithful to the data.*
___
## Biases: Thiên kiến
\- We can plot the data faithfully, but still perceive it wrongly!
\- **Careful when designing aggregated charts**: 
- Shows a “Misleading" representation of bar charts that hides the distribution of underlying data, compared to an “Improved" representation using violin plots.
- Should use median and confidence interval only when the data is a normal distribution
