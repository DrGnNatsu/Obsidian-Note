# Why is it called Scrum?
It is inspired by a scrum in the sport of rugby. In rugby, the team comes together in what they call a scrum to work together to move the ball forward. In this context, Scrum is where the team comes together to move the product forward.
- Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams, and organisations **generate value** through **adaptive solutions** for **complex problems**.
Think of Scrum as a way to get work done as a team in small pieces at a time, with continuous experimentation and feedback loops along the way to learn and improve as you go.
