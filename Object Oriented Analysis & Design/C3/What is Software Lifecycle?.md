# Software lifecycle
series of steps/phases, through which software is produced
- from conception to end-of-life
-  can take months or years to complete
## Planning
- Identify project scope, objectives, and feasibility (technical, operational, financial)
- Establish project goals, timeline, and budget.
## Define Requirements
- Elicit requirements from the stakeholders.
- Check if all user needs are captured.
- Output: System requirements specifications (SRS).
## Design and Prototyping
- Translate requirements into a blueprint for the system (architectural design, data design, interface design)
- Design both high-level and detailed components (e.g., database schema, UI Layouts).
## Software Development
- Developers write the actual code based on the design.
- Follow coding standards and best practices.
- Tools: Version control, IDEs, and development frameworks.
## Testing
- Verify the system meets requirements and is free from bugs.
- Types of testing: Unit testing, Integration testing, System testing, User acceptance testing (UAT).
## Deployment
- Release the system to the production environments.
- Discuss the different deployment strategies: pilot, phased, or full deployment.
## Operations and Maintenance
- Software is updated to fix bugs, improve performance, or add new features.
