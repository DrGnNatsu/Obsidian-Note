# What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. Design patterns in software development provide established **solutions to recurring design problems.**
## Why Design Patterns Matter in Development?
- Simplifies Communication: Patterns give developers a shared language to discuss design approaches.
- Improves Code Readability and Maintainability: Patterns provide a standardised way to solve problems.
- Enhances Reusability and Scalability: By reusing solutions, development becomes more efficient.
