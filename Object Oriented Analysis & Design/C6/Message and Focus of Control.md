- Messages (or signals) on a sequence diagram are specified using an arrow from the participant (message caller) who wants to pass the message to the participant (message receiver) who is to receive the message.
- A message is represented as an arrow going from the sender to the top of the focus of control (i.e., execution occurrence) of the message on the receiver’s lifeline.

In essence, ==synchronous activities happen simultaneously, requiring participants to be present at the same time, while asynchronous activities occur at different times, allowing participants to engage at their own pace==. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

Synchronous:
- **Real-time interaction:** Synchronous activities involve direct, immediate interaction between participants.
- **Examples:** Face-to-face meetings, phone calls, video conferences, and live online classes are all examples of synchronous activities. 
- **Pros:** Facilitates immediate feedback, allows for direct questions and answers, and can foster a sense of community. 
- **Cons:** Requires participants to be available at the same time, which can be challenging for those with different schedules or time zones. 
Asynchronous:
- **Delayed interaction:** Asynchronous activities allow participants to engage with content or each other at their convenience, without the need for real-time interaction. 
- **Examples:** Email, online forums, asynchronous online courses, and written communication are all examples of asynchronous activities. 
- **Pros:** Offers flexibility, allows participants to learn at their own pace, and can be more accessible for those with busy schedules. 
- **Cons:** This can lead to delayed feedback, may not be as engaging as real-time interaction, and can make it harder to build a sense of community. 
In the context of education:
- **Synchronous learning:** Involves students and instructors gathering at the same time and place to interact in real time.
- **Asynchronous** learning students access materials at their own pace and interact with each other over longer periods. 
In the context of communication:
- **Synchronous communication:** This happens in real-time, such as a phone call or video chat.
- **Asynchronous communication:** This happens at different times, such as via email or an online forum.
