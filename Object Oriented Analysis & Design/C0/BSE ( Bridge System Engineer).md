___
A "bridge system engineer" (BrSE) is ==a professional who acts as a communication link between a client and the development team on a project==, essentially bridging the gap between the customer's needs and the technical implementation by translating requirements and ensuring smooth project execution, often in offshore development scenarios where cultural and language differences might exist; they are responsible for understanding client needs, conveying them accurately to the development team, and managing project progress to ensure client satisfaction. 

Key points about a bridge system engineer:

- **Communication focus:**
    Their primary role is to facilitate clear communication between the client and development team, often requiring strong language skills and cultural awareness. 
- **Requirement gathering:**
    They gather detailed requirements from the client and translate them into technical specifications that the development team can understand. 
- **Project management aspects:**
    BrSEs often manage project timelines, track progress, and report back to the client on project status. 
- **Technical understanding:**
    While not necessarily deep technical experts, they need a good grasp of the project's technical aspects to effectively communicate with both sides.
