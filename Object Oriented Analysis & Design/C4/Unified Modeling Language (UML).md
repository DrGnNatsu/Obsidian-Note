# What is Unified Modeling Language (UML)?
- The **unified modeling language (UML)** - a ***language*** (not method) - is a general-purpose visual modeling language intended to provide a standard way to visualise the design of a system.
- UML provides a standard notation for many types of diagrams, which can be roughly divided into three main groups: behavior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams.
- The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardise the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design.
