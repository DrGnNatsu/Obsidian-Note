- Enclosing data by containing it within an object. In OOP, **encapsulation forms a barrier around data to protect it from the rest of the code**. 
- Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes. They can only call a list of public functions or methods.

There are 3 basic techniques to implement encapsulation in OOP:
-  Data member encapsulation
- Method encapsulation
- Class encapsulation
