- Modularity: Encapsulation enables objects to be self-contained, making troubleshooting and collaborative development easier.
- Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance, meaning a team does not have to write the same code multiple times.
- Productivity: Programmers can construct new programs quickly through the use of multiple libraries and reusable code.
- Easily upgradable and scalable: Programmers can implement system functionalities independently.
- Interface descriptions. Descriptions of external systems are simple, due to message-passing techniques that are used for object communication.
- Security. Using encapsulation and abstraction, complex code is hidden, software maintenance is easier and internet protocols are protected.
- Flexibility. Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to the class it is placed in. Different objects can also pass through the same interface.
- Code maintenance. Parts of a system can be updated and maintained without needing to make significant adjustments.
- Lower cost. Other benefits, such as its maintenance and reusability, reduce development costs.
