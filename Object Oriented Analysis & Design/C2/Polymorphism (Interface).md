- Objects are designed to share behaviours, and they can take on more than one form. A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class. Polymorphism enables different types of objects to pass through the same interface.
- Create a different version of the class
- All the class implements the interface that has the same method we defined in the interface.
