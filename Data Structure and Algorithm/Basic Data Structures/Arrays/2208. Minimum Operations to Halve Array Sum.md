==Link:== [Leetcode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-halve-array-sum/description/)
You are given an array of `nums` of positive integers. In one operation, you can choose **any** number from `nums` and reduce it to **exactly** half the number. (Note that you may choose this reduced number in future operations.)

Return _the **minimum** number of operations to reduce the sum of_ `nums` _by **at least** half._

**Example 1:**
	**Input:** nums = [5,19,8,1]
	**Output:** 3
	**Explanation:** The initial sum of nums is equal to 5 + 19 + 8 + 1 = 33.
	The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
	Pick the number 19 and reduce it to 9.5.
	Pick the number 9.5 and reduce it to 4.75.
	Pick the number 8 and reduce it to 4.
	The final array is [5, 4.75, 4, 1] with a total sum of 5 + 4.75 + 4 + 1 = 14.75. 
	The sum of nums has been reduced by 33 - 14.75 = 18.25, which is at least half of the initial sum, 18.25 >= 33/2 = 16.5.
	Overall, 3 operations were used, so we return 3.
	It can be shown that we cannot reduce the sum by at least half in less than 3 operations.

**Example 2:**
	**Input:** nums = [3,8,20]
	**Output:** 3
	**Explanation:** The initial sum of nums is equal to 3 + 8 + 20 = 31.
	The following is one of the ways to reduce the sum by at least half:
	Pick the number 20 and reduce it to 10.
	Pick the number 10 and reduce it to 5.
	Pick the number 3 and reduce it to 1.5.
	The final array is [1.5, 8, 5] with a total sum of 1.5 + 8 + 5 = 14.5. 
	The sum of nums has been reduced by 31 - 14.5 = 16.5, which is at least half of the initial sum, 16.5 >= 31/2 = 15.5.
	Overall, 3 operations were used so we return 3.
	It can be shown that we cannot reduce the sum by at least half in less than 3 operations.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 107`

# First Solution (Queue)
> Approach:
> 1️.  **Max-Heap Creation:** Use a Max-Heap (`PriorityQueue`) to track the largest elements.
> 2️. **Subtract Elements:** Repeatedly extract the largest elements and subtract the `sum`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int halveArray(int[] nums) {
		PriorityQueue<Double> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());  
		double sum = 0;  
		for (int num : nums) {  
		    pq.add(num * 1.0);  
		    sum += num;  
		}  
		int operations = 0;  
		double half = sum / 2;  
		while (sum > half) {  
		    double maxHalf = pq.poll() / 2;  
		    operations++;  
		    sum -= maxHalf;  
		    pq.add(maxHalf);  
		}  
		return operations;
	}
}

# Second Solution (Optimized First Solution)

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < k) pq.add(num);
        }
        int operations = 0;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int x = pq.poll();
            operations++;

            if (pq.isEmpty()) break;

            int y = pq.poll();
            long newValue = 2L * x + y;

            if (newValue < k) pq.add((int) newValue);
        }

        return operations;
    }

# Third Solution (Optimized First Solution) - Memory

```java
class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int min = 0;
        PriorityQueue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++) {
            queue.add(nums[i]);
        }
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            if(queue.size() >= 2) {
                if(queue.peek() >= Math.abs(k)) {
                    break;
                }
                Integer calc = queue.poll() * 2 + queue.poll();
                min++;
                queue.add(calc);

            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return min;
