Given an integer array of `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return _an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order_.

**Example 1:**
	**Input:** `nums` = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
	**Output:** [0,1,9,16,100]
	**Explanation:** After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
	After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

**Example 2:**
	**Input:** `nums` = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
	**Output:** [4,9,9,49,121]

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?

# First Solution (Sort)
> Approach:
> 1. We power all elements in the `nums` array by two.
> 2. Using the build-in sorting algorithm in the Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            nums[i] *= nums[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums;
    }
}
```
Time-Complexity: $O(nlogn)$
Space-Complexity: $O(1)$

# Second Solution (Two pointers)
==Solution==: [Reference Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/solutions/6149748/using-two-pointers)
> Approach:
> 1. The square of each number is positive or 0 which means we don't have to care about negative or positive for original numbers. We can focus only on numbers, even if they are negative. For example, `4` for `-4` or `1` for `-1`
> 2. Numbers at the edge of the array will produce bigger numbers because the input array is sorted and we only focus on numbers. In this case, A number at index `0` or  `4` will make the biggest square number.
> 3. From the idea above, it's a good idea to have two pointers starting from index `0` and the last index. Let's say `left` pointer and `right` pointer.
> 4. One more important point is that as I explain above, we don't have to care about negative or positive, so **we use an absolute value so that we can focus on only numbers.**
> 5. In this case, the right number will produce a bigger square, so this number should go to the last index of the result array(= `i`).
> 6. Then update `i` with `100` and `i` move next. After that `right` pointer also moves next.
To do that, simply we should have an index value starting from the last. Create an array with the same length as the input array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        for (int i = right; i >= 0 ; --i){
            if (Math.abs(nums[left]) > Math.abs(nums[right])){
                result[i] = nums[left] * nums[left++];
            }
            else {
                result[i] = nums[right] * nums[right--];
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
Time-Complexity: $O(n)$
Space-Complexity: $O(n)$ 
- If we consider creating the new array it takes the new space.
