==Link:== [Leetcode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-distinct-colors-among-the-balls/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-02-07)
You are given an integer `limit` and a 2D array `queries` of size `n x 2`.

There are `limit + 1` balls with **distinct** labels in the range `[0, limit]`. Initially, all balls are uncolored. For every query in `queries` that is of the form `[x, y]`, you mark ball `x` with the color `y`. After each query, you need to find the number of **distinct** colors among the balls.

Return an array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` denotes the number of distinct colors _after_ `ith` query.

**Note** that when answering a query, lack of a color _will not_ be considered as a color.

**Example 1:**
	**Input:** limit = 4, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[1,3],[3,4]]
	**Output:** [1,2,2,3]
	**Explanation:**
	![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/17/ezgifcom-crop.gif)
	- After query 0, ball 1 has color 4.
	- After query 1, ball 1 has color 4, and ball 2 has color 5.
	- After query 2, ball 1 has color 3, and ball 2 has color 5.
	- After query 3, ball 1 has color 3, ball 2 has color 5, and ball 3 has color 4.

**Example 2:**
	**Input:** limit = 4, queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5]]
	**Output:** [1,2,2,3,4]
	**Explanation:**
	**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/04/17/ezgifcom-crop2.gif)**
	- After query 0, ball 0 has color 1.
	- After query 1, ball 0 has color 1, and ball 1 has color 2.
	- After query 2, ball 0 has color 1, and balls 1 and 2 have color 2.
	- After query 3, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, and ball 3 has color 4.
	- After query 4, ball 0 has color 1, balls 1 and 2 have color 2, ball 3 has color 4, and ball 4 has color 5.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= limit <= 109`
- `1 <= n == queries.length <= 105`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queries[i][0] <= limit`
- `1 <= queries[i][1] <= 109`

# First Solution (Hashmpa)
> Approach:
>- **Track Colors:** Maintain a map recording each ball’s current color.
>- **Count Frequencies:** Keep a frequency map for how many balls have each color.
>- **Update on Repaint:** For every query, if a ball is repainted, decrement the count of its old color (removing it if zero) and increment the new color’s count.

> Approach:
> 1. Create two Hash-map
> 	1. The `ball` contains the `ballNumber` and `colour` of that ball.
> 	2. The `colourCount` contains the `colour` of the ball and the times it paints on the ball.
> 2. The `answer` is supported for the answer, and the `distinct` represents the number of distinct colours.
> 3. Create the for loop:
> 	1. We have `ballNumber = queries[i][0], colour = queries[i][1]`.
> 	2. If `ballNumber` is not existing in the `ball`, we add it to the `ball` and if that colour is equal to `1` mean that it is distinct.
> 	3.  If `ballNumber` is existing in the `ball` (repaint the ball), we check that `colour` is distinct are not.
> 		1. If it is distinct, the `count` will equal to 0. We will remove that colour in the `colourCount` and `--distinct`.
> 		2. Otherwise, we assign the new count of the colour.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] queryResults(int limit, int[][] queries) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> ball = new HashMap<>(), colourCount = new HashMap<>();
        int[] answer = new int[queries.length];
        int distinct = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; ++i) {
            int ballNumber = queries[i][0], colour = queries[i][1];
            if (ball.containsKey(ballNumber)) {
                int count = colourCount.get(ball.get(ballNumber)) - 1;
                if (count == 0) {
                    colourCount.remove(ball.get(ballNumber));
                    --distinct;
                }
                else {
                    colourCount.put(ball.get(ballNumber), count);
                }
            }
            ball.put(ballNumber, colour);
            int count = colourCount.getOrDefault(colour, 0) + 1;
            colourCount.put(colour, count);
            if (count == 1) ++distinct;
            answer[i] = distinct;
        }
        return answer;
    }
