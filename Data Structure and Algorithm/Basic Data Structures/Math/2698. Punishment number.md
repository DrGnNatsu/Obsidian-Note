Given a positive integer `n`, return _the **punishment number**_ of `n`.
The **punishment number** of `n` is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers `i` such that:
- `1 <= i <= n`
- The decimal representation of `i * i` can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals `i`.

**Example 1:**
	**Input:** n = 10
	**Output:** 182
	**Explanation:** There are exactly 3 integers i in the range [1, 10] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
	- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1
	- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1 with a sum equal to 8 + 1 == 9.
	- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 and 0 with a sum equal to 10 + 0 == 10.
	Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182

**Example 2:**
	**Input:** n = 37
	**Output:** 1478
	**Explanation:** There are exactly 4 integers i in the range [1, 37] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
	- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1. 
	- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1. 
	- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0. 
	- 36 since 36 * 36 = 1296 and 1296 can be partitioned into 1 + 29 + 6.
	Hence, the punishment number of 37 is 1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 1000`

# First Solution ()
> Approach:
>1. Iterate Through Numbers (1 to n): For each number curr, compute its square square = curr * curr.
>2. Check if the Square Can Be Partitioned
	A helper function can partition (num, target) recursively verifies whether num (the square of curr) can be partitioned such that its segments sum to target (which is curr).  The function considers different segmentations:
		Taking the last digit (num % 10)
        Taking the last two digits (num % 100)
        Taking the last three digits (num % 1000), etc.
>3. Update the Punishment Number: If canPartition() returns true, add square to the punishmentNum.
>4. Return the Final Sum: The sum of all valid squares is returned as the punishment number.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPartition(int n, int target) {
        if (n < target || target < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        if (n == target) {
            return true;
        }
        return (
            canPartition(n / 10, target - (n % 10)) ||
            canPartition(n / 100, target - (n % 100)) ||
            canPartition(n / 1000, target - (n % 1000)) 
        );
    }
    public int punishmentNumber(int n) {
        int punishmentNum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            int square = i * i;
            if (canPartition(square, i)) {
                punishmentNum += square;
            }
        }
        return punishmentNum;
    }
}

## Explain
Let's break down the `canPartition` function step-by-step with a more detailed explanation and a specific example. The key to understanding it is recognizing its recursive nature and how it explores different partitioning possibilities.

**Core Idea:**

The `canPartition(int n, int target)` function tries to determine if the number `n` (which is the square of some integer `i`) can be split into a sum of its digits or groups of digits such that the sum equals the original integer `i` (which is the `target`). It does this by trying different combinations of how to split the digits of `n`.

**Explanation with a more visual example: Let's say `n = 1296` and `target = 36`**

We want to know if 1296 can be partitioned into a sum that equals 36.

1. **Initial Call: `canPartition(1296, 36)`**

2. **Base Case Checks:**
   - `1296 < 36` is `false`
   - `1296 == 36` is `false`

3. **Recursive Calls:**  The function now tries different ways to "peel off" digits (or groups of digits) from the *right* side of `1296` and subtract them from the `target`. It makes three recursive calls (as shown in the code):

   - **Call 1: Consider the last digit (6):**
     - `canPartition(1296 / 10, 36 - (1296 % 10))` which simplifies to
     - `canPartition(129, 36 - 6)` which is
     - `canPartition(129, 30)`

   - **Call 2: Consider the last two digits (96):**
     - `canPartition(1296 / 100, 36 - (1296 % 100))` which simplifies to
     - `canPartition(12, 36 - 96)` which is
     - `canPartition(12, -60)`

   - **Call 3: Consider the last three digits (296):**
     - `canPartition(1296 / 1000, 36 - (1296 % 1000))` which simplifies to
     - `canPartition(1, 36 - 296)` which is
     - `canPartition(1, -260)`

4. **Evaluating the Recursive Calls:**  Now, each of these calls to `canPartition` has to be evaluated.

   - **`canPartition(129, 30)`:**  This will, in turn, make *its own* three recursive calls:
     - `canPartition(12, 30 - 9)` which is `canPartition(12, 21)`
     - `canPartition(1, 30 - 29)` which is `canPartition(1, 1)`
     - `canPartition(0, 30 - 129)` which is `canPartition(0, -99)`
     - The call `canPartition(1, 1)` will return `true` because `n == target`.  Therefore `canPartition(129, 30)` will return true.

   - **`canPartition(12, -60)`:** Since the `target` is negative, this immediately returns `false`.

   - **`canPartition(1, -260)`:**  Since the `target` is negative, this immediately returns `false`.

5. **Combining the results:**

   - The original call `canPartition(1296, 36)` will return `true` because its first recursive call, `canPartition(129, 30)`, returned `true`.

**Why this works:**

The recursion is essentially trying every possible way to break up the number into contiguous substrings. If *any* of these ways results in a sum that equals the `target`, the function returns `true`.

**In our example, what did we find?**

We found a way to partition 1296 as 1 + 29 + 6.  Let's look at the chain of events that led us to this:

6. `canPartition(1296, 36)` called `canPartition(129, 30)` because it peeled off the last digit (6).
7. `canPartition(129, 30)` called `canPartition(12, 21)` by peeling off the last digit (9) from 129.
8. `canPartition(12, 21)` is not fruitful. It return `false`.
9. `canPartition(129, 30)` called `canPartition(1, 1)` by peeling of the last two digit(29) from 129.
10. `canPartition(1, 1)` which return true.

So the partition path is 1,29,6 , which matches 36.

**Simplified Analogy:**

Imagine you have a pile of coins worth 1296 cents, and you want to see if you can make a sum of exactly 36 cents by taking groups of coins from the right-hand side of the pile. The `canPartition` function is trying all possible combinations of grabbing groups of coins to see if you can reach 36 cents.

**Key Improvements for Understanding:**

*   **Focus on Recursion:** Understand that each call to `canPartition` creates a new "branch" of possibilities.
*   **Base Cases are Crucial:** They stop the recursion and determine success or failure.
*   **Visualize the Tree:** Imagine a tree where each node represents a call to `canPartition` and its children are the recursive calls it makes. The function returns `true` if any path down the tree reaches a "success" leaf (where `n == target`).
*   **Tracing is Key:**  Work through examples like the one above, carefully writing down the arguments to each call and the return values. This will help you see how the function explores the different partitioning possibilities.
