==Link:== [Leetcode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-operations-to-make-all-elements-divisible-by-three/
You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from **any** element of `nums`.

Return the **minimum** number of operations to make all elements of `nums` divisible by 3.

**Example 1:**
	**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
	**Output:** 3
	**Explanation:**
	All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:
	- Subtract 1 from 1.
	- Add 1 to 2.
	- Subtract 1 from 4.

**Example 2:**
	**Input:** nums = [3,6,9]
	**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`

# First Solution 
> Approach:
>1. If we divide a number by three we have three case.
>	1. If `num % 3 == 0`the operations need to modify is `0`.
>	2. If `num % 3 == 1` the operations need to modify is `1` (subtract that number to 1).
>	3. If `num % 3 == 2` the operations need to modify is `1` (add that number to 1).
>2. We get the insight that if the number is If `num % 3 == 0` the operations need to modify is `0` other case is `1`.
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num: nums) {
            if (num % 3 != 0) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
