# Problem
==Link:== [Leetcode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=2rs8aste)
Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, _delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once_. Return _the linked list **sorted** as well_.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list1.jpg)
	**Input:** head = [1,1,2]
	**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/list2.jpg)
	**Input:** head = [1,1,2,3,3]
	**Output:** [1,2,3]

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.

# First Solution
> Approach:
>1. Create a new node `answer` with value 0 and set its next pointer to the 'head' of the input linked list. This simplifies handling the edge case where the head node of the linked list needs to be removed.
>2. Create a new node `dummy` and set it to `ans`. This `dummy` node will be used to traverse the linked list and remove nodes with the value `val`.
>3. Start a while loop that continues until the `dummy` is Null. This loop iterates through the linked list.
>4. Inside the outer while loop, start another while loop that continues as long as the `dummy.next` is  None and the value of `dummy.next` is equal to `val`. This inner loop skips all the consecutive nodes with the value val.
>5. Inside the inner while loop, update the `next` pointer of `dummy` to skip the node with the value `val` by setting it to `dummy.next.next`. This effectively removes the node with the value `val` from the linked list.
>6. After the inner while loop, move the `dummy` one step forward by setting it to `dummy.next`. This is done to continue traversing the linked list.
>7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the inner while loop can no longer find consecutive nodes with the value `val`. At this point, the `dummy` will be pointing to the last node in the original linked list, or None if all nodes with the value `val` have been removed.
>8. Return the `next` pointer of `answer`, which is the head of the modified linked list with nodes containing the value `val` removed.

        while (dummy.next != null) {
            if (dummy.val == dummy.next.val) {
                dummy.next = dummy.next.next;
            }
            else dummy = dummy.next;
