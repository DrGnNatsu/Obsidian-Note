==Link:== [Leetcode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=linked-list)
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.
Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
	**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
	**Output:** true
	**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**
	![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
	**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
	**Output:** true
	**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
	**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
	**Output:** false
	**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked list.

# First Solution ( Two Pointers)
> Approach:
>1. Initialise `fast` and `slow` pointers to the head of the linked list:
>	`fast` and `slow` are initially pointing to the head of the linked list, which is the starting point.
>2. Enter a loop while both `fast` and `fast.next` are not null.
> 	This loop will continue until either `fast` or `fast.next` becomes null, indicating the end of the linked list or if there is no cycle.
>3. Move the `fast` pointer two steps ahead (`fast = fast.next.next`) and the `slow` pointer one step ahead (`slow = slow.next`).
>	This step simulates the two-pointer traversal where `fast` moves twice as fast as `slow`.
>4. Check if `fast` is equal to `slow`.
    If `fast` and `slow` pointers meet at the same node, it means there is a cycle in the linked list, and we return `True`.
>5. If the loop exits without finding a cycle, return `False`.
	If the loop completes without finding a cycle, it means that the `fast` pointer has reached the end of the list, and there is no cycle. In this case, we return `False`.
>
>This algorithm uses two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, to traverse the linked list. The `fast` pointer moves twice as fast as the `slow` pointer. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list, and the function will return `False`. This algorithm is an efficient way to detect cycles in a singly-linked list.
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
