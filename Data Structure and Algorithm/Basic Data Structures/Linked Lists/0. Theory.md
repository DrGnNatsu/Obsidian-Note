Linked List is a part of the [Collection framework](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-in-java-2/) present in [java.util package](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-util-package-java/). This class is an implementation of the [LinkedList data structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/linked-list/) which is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses and each element is known as a node.
\- You can imagine that the linked list is similar to the set of box with connected by the one-direction string. The structure of the linked list has two parts:
- Value attribute that contains the value of that node in the linked list.
- Pointer attribute that directs the address of the next box.
## Node code

```java
class Node {
	int data;
	Node next;
	public Node(int data) {
		this.data = data;
	}
	public Node(int data, Node next) {
		this.data = data;
		this.next = next;
	}
}
```
## Count Node Code
![[Count node.png]]
```java
public static int countNodes(Node head) {
	int count = 1;
	Node current = head;
	while (current.next != null) {
		current = current.next;
		++count;
	}
	return count;
}
```
