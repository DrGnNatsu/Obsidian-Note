==Link:== [Leetcode Problem Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=linked-list)
Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that have `Node.val == val`, and return _the new head_.
**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/removelinked-list.jpg)
	**Input:** head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
	**Output:** [1,2,3,4,5]

**Example 2:**
	**Input:** head = [], val = 1
	**Output:** []

**Example 3:**
	**Input:** head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
	**Output:** []

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 50`

# First Solution 
> Approach:
>1. Create a new node `answer` with value 0 and set its next pointer to the 'head' of the input linked list. This simplifies handling the edge case where the head node of the linked list needs to be removed.
>2. Create a new node `dummy` and set it to `ans`. This `dummy` node will be used to traverse the linked list and remove nodes with the value `val`.
>3. Start a while loop that continues until the `dummy` is Null. This loop iterates through the linked list.
>4. Inside the outer while loop, start another while loop that continues as long as the `dummy.next` is  None and the value of `dummy.next` is equal to `val`. This inner loop skips all the consecutive nodes with the value val.
>5. Inside the inner while loop, update the `next` pointer of `dummy` to skip the node with the value `val` by setting it to `dummy.next.next`. This effectively removes the node with the value `val` from the linked list.
>6. After the inner while loop, move the `dummy` one step forward by setting it to `dummy.next`. This is done to continue traversing the linked list.
>7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the inner while loop can no longer find consecutive nodes with the value `val`. At this point, the `dummy` will be pointing to the last node in the original linked list, or None if all nodes with the value `val` have been removed.
>8. Return the `next` pointer of `answer`, which is the head of the modified linked list with nodes containing the value `val` removed.

``` java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
		// Create an answer node to handle edge cases where the head needs to be removed  
		ListNode answer = new ListNode(0, head);  
		// Initialize the dummy pointer to the ans node  
		ListNode dummy = answer;  
		// Traverse the list  
		while (dummy.next != null) {  
		    // If the next node's value matches the target value, skip the node  
		    if (dummy.next.val == val) {  
		        dummy.next = dummy.next.next;  
		    } else {  
		        // Otherwise, move to the next node  
		        dummy = dummy.next;  
		    }  
		}  
		return answer.next;
    }
}

# Second Solution (Recursion)
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        if (head == null) {
            return null; 
        }
        if (head.val == val) {
            return removeElements(head.next, val);
        } else {
            head.next = removeElements(head.next, val);
            return head;
        }
