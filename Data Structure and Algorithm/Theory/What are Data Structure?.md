# Meaning of Algorithms
\- The algorithm is the operations on different data structures and the instructions for executing them.
\- The algorithm is the mathematics of problem-solving.
==Ex==: Based on the example of the data structure.
\- We have the sets of instructions for finding the shortest path to the school:
1. Find the places you can go from home
2. From each of those places, find all paths
3. Keep track of the distance you have travelled as you go
4. Repeat this process until you get to school
5. Compare the distance you have travelled 
6. Find the shortest path
