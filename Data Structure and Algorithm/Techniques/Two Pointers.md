# Two Pointers Technique
The two-pointer technique is a fundamental algorithmic approach that plays a pivotal role in optimizing solutions to specific types of problems in computer science. This strategy involves the use of two pointers, often represented as indices or references, that traverse a data structure, such as an array, list, or string, simultaneously. By manipulating the positions of these two pointers, the technique aims to efficiently address a wide range of problems, making it a valuable tool in a programmer’s toolkit.
## Implement method
> Start the pointers at the edges of the input. Move them towards each other until they meet.

Converting this idea into instructions:
1. Start one pointer at the first index `0` and the other pointer at the last index `input.length - 1`.
2. Use a while loop until the pointers are equal to each other.
3. At each iteration of the loop, move the pointers towards each other. This means either increment the pointer that started at the first index, decrease the pointer that started at the last index, or both. Deciding which pointers to move will depend on the problem we are trying to solve.
## Power of the Two Pointers Technique
### 1. Efficiency
- Two pointers often provide efficient solutions to problems that might otherwise have suboptimal time complexity. It can reduce time complexity from quadratic (e.g., O(n²)) to linear or even linearithmic (e.g., O(n log n)).
### 2. Space Efficiency
- Unlike some other techniques, Two Pointers typically doesn’t require extra space apart from the pointers themselves. This makes it an attractive choice when optimizing for space complexity.
### 3. Versatility
- Two-pointers can be applied to a wide range of problems, making it a valuable tool in a programmer’s toolkit.
## Problems Solved with Two Pointers

Two Pointers can tackle an array of problems. Here are some common categories:
### 1. Searching and Summation
- Two Sum Problem: Given an array, find two numbers that add up to a specific target sum.
### 2. Array Manipulation
- Container With Most Water: Find two lines in an array of heights that form a container with the most water.
### 3. List Manipulation
- Reverse a String or List: Efficiently reverse a string, array, or linked list.
### 4. Linked List Algorithms
- Linked List Cycle Detection: Detecting a cycle in a linked list can be achieved using Two Pointers (Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm).
### 5. Sorting and Merging
- Merge Sorted Arrays or Lists: Merge two sorted arrays or linked lists efficiently.
### 6. String Manipulation
- Many string manipulation problems, such as checking for palindromes, finding substrings, or performing in-place replacements, can benefit from Two Pointers.

Here are examples of effective Two Pointer algorithms:
### 1. Two Sum Problem
- Use two pointers to maintain left and right bounds. Move the pointers inward, adjusting based on the sum compared to the target.
### 2. Merge Sorted Arrays or Lists
- Start from the end of the arrays or lists and merge elements in decreasing order.
### 3. Reverse a String or List
- Use two pointers starting from the ends and swap elements until they meet in the middle.
### 4. Container With Most Water
- Utilize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end. Calculate the area formed by these two pointers and move the pointer with the shorter height toward the centre to search for a potentially larger area.
