| Complex instruction: multiple operations (operand) / instruction. **CPI↑**. <br>($a+b\times c$) | Simple instruction: one operation. **IC↑**.  Less hardware resources ⇒ Integrate more cores and optimise.<br> |

## Von Neumann Architecture
Contains three mains components:
- Main memory (M): stored all the data and the software application.
- Central Processing Unit (CPU): Arithmetic logic unit (CA) and Program Control Unit (CC): All of execution of the program are executed by CPU.
- I/O Equipment: (I, O).
Stored-program concept
Instruction Category:
- Arithmetic 
- Data Transfer
- Logical
- Conditional branch
- Unconditional jump
